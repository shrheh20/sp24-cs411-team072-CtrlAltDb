# Project Description
The UIUC Course Hub is a web application that provides University of Illinois students with comprehensive course information across all departments. It aims to centralize data such as course content, average GPA, professor ratings, and user reviews, making it easier for students to make informed decisions about their course selections. The application will aggregate publicly available data, such as course details from the Course Explorer API and GPA statistics from the WadeFagan GPA Datasets, and combine it with student crowdsourced reviews. It will offer features like detailed course exploration, sorting and filtering options, and GPT-generated summaries to enhance the user experience. Users can contribute their reviews and manage their contributions through secure login with their NetIDs.
